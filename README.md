A peer-to-peer video streaming application using WebRTC that allows direct video sharing between two computers without requiring a server for media relaying.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Direct P2P Connection**: Stream video files directly between peers using WebRTC
- **No Media Server Required**: Only signaling needed for connection setup
- **Interactive Controls**: Play/pause/seek synchronization between peers
- **Modern UI**: Sleek, responsive interface with gradient accents
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any modern browser that supports WebRTC

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Role Selection**: One peer acts as Host (streamer), the other as Client (viewer)
2. **Signaling Exchange**: Connection data is copied/pasted between peers
3. **Direct Streaming**: Once connected, video streams directly between browsers
4. **Synchronized Playback**: Play/pause/seek actions are mirrored between peers
